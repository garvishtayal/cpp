# C++ Revision Notes

Minimal C++ code snippets for **quick revision before interviews & contests**.

## What’s inside
- Core DSA implementations (Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs)
- Common algorithms (Two Pointers, Recursion, Divide & Conquer)
- STL usage (vector, map, set, priority_queue)
- Time & Space complexity notes in comments
